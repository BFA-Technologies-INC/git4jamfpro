In order for Teamviewer to have our branding, it needs to have a configuration ID set. 
When we update with a standard package, our branding is not included
If we update directly from our TeamViewer instance, our branding is included.
This script sets our ID as $4 (in case it were to change in the future we can easily change)
This way we can use a standard package to update w/o logging into TV every time.
When Teamviewer is updated, this script should be in the policy to apply afterwards
As of 12/2020 the ID should be idcuhn5535</notes>
