Note on managed configuration profile

If you apply the managed configuration profile, all parameters passed into the script will be ignored. The script looks for the profile located at /Library/Managed Preferences/xyz.techitout.elevate.plist and will ignore the params passed in from a Jamf Pro policy. This is the ensure that the settings applied at the MDM level are respected.</notes>
